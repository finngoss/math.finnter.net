    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a fourth-year undergraduate at Yale University studying mathematics. I am hoping to attend graduate school and become a professional mathematician.
    </p>
    <p>My primary interests are the geometry of numbers and arithmetic dynamics.
    </p>
    <p>Aside from pure math, I am also fascinated by ethnomathematics: the study of the relationships between mathematics and cultures (emphasis on the pluralities).
       This interest typically manifests in studies into the rich intersection between mathematics and fiber arts. 
        On the one hand, mathematics may provide art with powerful disambiguating language and abstract inspiration. 
        On the other, mathematics as a field can only be strengthend by improving its relationship to craft traditions and cultural information systems outside of the written, academic tradition. 
        By recognizing that mathematical knowledge can manifest itself in a variety of formats we are rewarded with a far grander and cosmopolitan mathematics, one that better encompasses comprehensive human understanding related to notions of number, measure, symmetry, and shape.

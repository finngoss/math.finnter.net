<h2>Library</h2>
Mostly hyperlinks to digital resources about the intersection of mathematics and fiber arts. 
<dl>
    <dt>Zeroes and Ones: Digital Women and the New Technoculture by Sadie Plant</dt>
        <dd>A must read for anyone interested in the shared history of women's work, weaving, computer science, and the internet.</dd>
        <dd>A loveletter to Ada Lovelace, Enchantress of Numbers and Princess of Parallelograms.</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/patterns/weaving/monographs/dak_alge.pdf">Ada K. Dietz Algebraic Expressions in Handwoven Textiles</a></dt>
        <dd>Incredible monograph in which she details her technique for deriving aesthetically pleasing woven designs from algebraic expressions.</dd>
    
    <dt><a href="https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/patterns/weaving/webdocs/gre_fctl.pdf">Ralph Grisworld on Fractals in Weaving</a></dt>
        <dd>Creating interesting textiles from fractal sequences.</dd>
        <dd><a href="https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/patterns/weaving/front_door.html">His website</a> is full of free patterns!</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/patterns/weaving/webdocs/opr_nddw.pdf">Ralph Griswold on Network Drafting for Double Weave</a></dt>
        <dd>Applying network draft techniques to double weave creates incredible results.</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2219842/#code">Geodata Weaving</a></dt>
        <dd>Does a great job demonstrating how fiber arts can embody any information.</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://www.blackmountaincollege.org/journal/volume-15/blazejack/">Perpetua Digital Weaving Project</a></dt>
        <dd>Example of digital weaving as a generative art.</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://weavingxcoding.studio/#Resources">Weaving to Code, Coding to Weave</a></dt>
        <dd>Page for an artistic workshop about the shared history between weaving and coding. It links a few interesting reads.</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://mathgrrl.com/yarncraft/">mathgrrl - yarncraft</a></dt>
        <dd>Fun online tools for computational fiber artists that really highlights the intersection between fiber arts, coding, and math.</dd>
        <dd>Highlight is definitely her 'matrixweaver.'</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://youtu.be/oMOSiag3dxg?si=7Xhi_XTTHRpCR2In">""It's Just Matrix Multiplication": Notation for Weaving" by Lea Albaugh </a></dt>
        <dd>Great YouTube video that explains the connection between weave structures and matrix multiplication.</dd>
        <dd>She also details the basics of network drafting.</dd>

    <dt><a href="http://www.toroidalsnark.net/mathknit.html">The Home of Mathematical Knitting</a></dt>
        <dd>Great resource for knitting patterns as well as just appreciating how much beautiful mathematics can be represented and made tangibly accessible by the fiber arts!</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/projects/fbz/1d-elementary-cellular-automata-01001001-scarf">Cellular Automata Rule 73 Scarf Pattern on Ravelry</a></dt>
        <dd>Ravelry is a site where fiber artists share patterns for their designs. This one is meant for a knitting machine and is based on an elementary cellular automata.</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~izak/Crochet/index.html">Mathematical Crochet</a></dt>
        <dd>Cute blog with some nice crocheted embeddings of various topological surfaces.</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://plannedpooling.com">Planned Pooling</a></dt>
        <dd>Nice website for visualizing planned pooling, a knitting/crochet technique in which multi-colored yarn with a repeating sequence of colors can be intentionally worked to create interesting patterns via modular arithmetic.</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/program/semester_program_workshop/sp-f19-w4#section-1">ICERM - Computational Textile Working Group Archive</a></dt>
        <dd>Tons of lecture videos available on the mathematics of knitting and other textile arts.</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://im.icerm.brown.edu/">ICERM - Illustrating Mathematics</a></dt>
        <dd>Contians several exampels of mathematical ideas represented in fiber arts.</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://youtu.be/34j4CppfRTA?si=JC3Yv5pw8YskUC4b">Topological Dunce Hat</a></dt>
        <dd>A YouTube video demonstrating a topological dunce hat made from cloth and two zippers.</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://craftinatorics.com/">Craftinatorics</a></dt>
        <dd>An amazing personal website dedicated to the mathematics of knitting and quilting.</dd>
    
    <dt><a href="https://backstrapweaving.wordpress.com/gallery/">Laverne Waddington's Backstrap Weaving Gallery</a></dt>
        <dd>Blog about backstrap weaving. I've linked her gallery to show some examples of the beautiful geometries modern weavers are able to create with traditional technologies and techniques.</dd>
